# Ethereal Devlopment Website

<br>

<p>A fully-responsive freelancing website I created during Lockdown. Responsive nav, JS Typewriter effect and working PHP contact form.</p>

<br>

#### Built using:

<ul>
    <li>HTML & SCSS</li>
    <li>Vanilla JS</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
</ul>

<br>

## Homepage

<p>Functionality includes sticky nav that vanishes when at the top of the screen and a typewriter effect in the title text that cycles the words 'Mobile First', 'Fully Responsive', 'Search Engine Friendly' and 'Professional' </p>

## PHP Contact Us Form

<p>Due to limitations with JS I built the Contact Us form with PHP to allow a seamless user experience. Allowing the user to send an email direct from the website without having to be redirected to their email app.</p>
